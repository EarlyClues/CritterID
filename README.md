The detection of/interaction with Alternative Autonomous Consciousnesses 

Consider the theory that UFOs/Djinn/Fairies etc. represent an alternative branch of liminal consciousness which reflects the Zeitgeist of the culture in which they are encountered. Thus, Muslim cultures which expect Djinn encounter them. The Medieval Europeans expected abduction by the "Good People" and this is what happened (see "Passport to Magonia" by Vallee). UFOs appeared during the Space Age and shared characteristics with entities from SciFi.

Now, in the Information Age, we posit that these Alternative Autonomous Consciousnesses may also begin to manifest online. How best do we locate, detect, and interact with these Critters, both online, in DreamSpace, and in the Waking World?
